REGAL RIDES — QUICK DEPLOY GUIDE
Last updated: 2025-09-20

FILES
- index.html — your one‑page website (black & gold, booking form, contact info).
- You can upload just this single file to your hosting and it will work.

HOW TO USE (EASIEST)
1) Download the ZIP.
2) Unzip it. Inside you'll see index.html.
3) Open index.html to preview.
4) Upload index.html to your hosting:
   • Netlify: go to app.netlify.com → Sites → drag & drop index.html (or the folder).
   • Vercel: vercel.com → New Project → choose "Other" → upload index.html.
   • cPanel/Bluehost/Namecheap: File Manager → public_html → upload index.html.
5) Change contact email/phone in the file if needed (search for hello@regalrides.com or 567‑328‑1378).

NEXT STEPS
- Replace hello@regalrides.com with your real email, or set that email up.
- Add prices under Services or create a Rates page later.
- Connect a real booking backend later (Stripe / Square / Zapier).
